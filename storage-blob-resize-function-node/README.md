# Azure Storage Blob Trigger Image Resize Function in Node.js

This sample implements a function triggered by Azure Blob Storage to resize an image in Node.js. Once the image is resized, the thumbnail image is uploaded back to blob storage.

The key aspects of this sample are in the function bindings and implementation.

## Function bindings
In order to interface with image data, you need to configure the function to process binary data.

The following code sets the `datatype` parameter to `binary` in the `function.json` file.

```javascript
{
  "disabled": false,
  "bindings": [
    {
      "name": "myBlob",
      "type": "blobTrigger",
      "direction": "in",
      "path": "images/{name}",
      "connection": "AzureWebJobsStorage",
      "datatype": "binary" // required to process buffer as image
    }
  ]
}
```


## Function implementation

The sample uses [Jimp](https://github.com/oliver-moran/jimp) to resize an incoming buffer to a thumbnail. The buffer is then converted to a stream (as required by [createBlockBlobFromStream](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/javascript/api/azure-storage/blobservice?view=azure-node-latest#createblockblobfromstream-container--blob---stream---streamlength--options--callback-)) and uploaded to Azure Storage.


```javascript
const stream = require('stream');
const Jimp = require('jimp');

const storage = require('azure-storage');
const blobService = storage.createBlobService();

module.exports = (context, myBlob) => {

    const widthInPixels = 100;
    const blobName = context.bindingData.name;
    const contentType = context.bindingData.properties.contentType;

    Jimp.read(myBlob).then((thumbnail) => {

        thumbnail.resize(widthInPixels, Jimp.AUTO);

        const options = {
            contentSettings: { contentType: contentType }
        };

        thumbnail.getBuffer(Jimp.MIME_PNG, (err, buffer) => {

            const readStream = stream.PassThrough();
            readStream.end(buffer);

            blobService.createBlockBlobFromStream('thumbnails', blobName, readStream, buffer.length, options, (err) => {
                context.done();
            });
        });

    }).catch(context.log);
};
```

You can use the [Azure Storage Explorer](https://azure.microsoft.com/features/storage-explorer/) to view blob containers and verify the resize is successful.
